                    <p class="mb-30">Throughout the first week of USERDES class, it is the first time that I was introduced to Trello. I
                        was amazed to know that there was a collaborative site like Trello. It was my first time to use this kind of
                        site. Working with Trello made me realized that collaboration and cooperation will make tasks easier
                        and faster.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">With the help of others, I was able to get some ideas that I can improve and make the work
                        better. But with one’s negligence, the work can be ruined. So, I realized that working with teams, one
                        should be careful in his/her action so that wrong doings can be avoided. The activities that we’ve done
                        through the week helped me improved and enhance my writing skills. The first activity helped me
                        expressed my self more. It also helped me know my classmates more. The lessons and activities
                        encouraged me to explore more ideas and improve my skills. I realized that I’m enjoying this subject
                        since our professor will let us do what we want without restricting us with some rules (example: “your
                        work should be this or that…”). I was amazed in myself because I cannot believe that I am able to find
                        more ideas or solutions better than before.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">I’m hoping that this class will help me to know myself better and help me know what I truly
                        desire. I am also looking forward that this class will say collaborative and enjoyable. I am having fun with
                        this subject so far.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">During this second week, we were tasked create and design an application that will provide solutions on relevant problems. </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">In doing need finding, my groupmates and I thought of many problems that we want to aid through an application. I realized that we should focus on the things that are closer to us. I mean focus on the problems that we know we can provide solution. So, we came up with a problem that we want to provide. A problem that we, as a student, experienced in our school life. I'm overwhelmed with my groupmates because they are interested and willing to cooperate with each other. They are also open-minded with the different ideas that we gathered. I am grateful that my groupmates and I agreed on the same idea that we had. We didn't encounter any miscommunication since we are all ears when someone is discussing his/her idea. </p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">With what happened this week, I didn't find anything hard since it's a collaborative work and I find it easy working with others than working alone. I hope that my groupmates stay interested in our project as the time goes by.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">Making my first web application isn’t hard at all since I already have knowledge and experiences on basic html during my senior high school days. I enjoy doing html because I find it easier than any other programming languages.  </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">I found out that the software Sublime text is much easier to use when making a html application than doing it in the notepad.  I love how sophisticated it is and the interface is better than any other application. When it comes to creating a repository on Github, I think it was very useful and convenient for a user. You can view your repositories anytime and anywhere. Creating a repository was easy since it is not my first time in using it, but it was my first time to use Heroku. At first, I thought it was hard, but you will only need to connect it to your Github repository so that you can view your application. I love the features of Github in which you can view, edit or delete in your repository. </p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">I think Github and Heroku were an application that everyone should know because it is a great help specially when speaking in terms of storage. You do not need to bring your flash drive or device (in which where your application was stored) whenever you want to view or edit your application. These applications are great way to lessen the hassle of the users.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">Creating a user interface gave me a hard time since we still didn’t finalize what our application is. I find it hard because I still don’t have any idea on what it will looked like even though some of the features where given to us. </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">It is hard for me to create a user interface without a proper knowledge on what application we will be having because I don’t know what the user needs. I still don’t have an idea on what other features that we will be needing since we were not still sure on the target audiences that we want to help. I think it is very important to know first the need of your target audience in able for you to create an effective user interface that users can use without them having a hard time. Though I enjoy making a user interface since I am freely to play with colors and what other buttons that I want. I think it also helped me to visualize what out application will look like and how it will work for the users. </p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">Making a user interface maybe hard at first but I think it will be easier when you know exactly what the needs of the users and how you want your application can help them. I hope that these days we can create an effective user interface for our target audiences.</p>
